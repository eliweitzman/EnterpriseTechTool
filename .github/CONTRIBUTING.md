# How to Contribute to Eli's Enterprise Tech Toolkit!

First off, thank you so much for your interest in contributing to ETT! We truly appreciate it. If you're here to help us in development, here are some guidelines that we'd like you to follow. You can contribute in two ways:

## Ideas

If you have an idea or feature request, but not the technical knowledge to back it fully, no fret! Just create an [issue](https://github.com/eliweitzman/EnterpriseTechTool/issues/new/choose) using the appropriate templace, and put in as many details as possible, and we'll try to get to it as quickly as possible!

Before creating your issue, please be sure to review the following:

- Make sure the idea/bug has not already been reported. If it has, and you have new information to provide, please comment on the existing issue.
- Describe your bug, idea, or feature request as verbosely and detailed as possible. If it's a bug, explain what you expect to happen and what actually happened. If possible, add steps to reproduce the issue.
- Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to help identify the problem.

## Contributing to Development

For ETT, there will be two main development branches. The main branch, which is updated at release, and the dev branch, which is where all changes will occur. If you want to make a change, the process is quite simple! Just create a personal fork of the repository, keep it up-to-date with the main repository, and make any modifications in the fork on a new branch. When it comes time for you to want to add it to the general codebase, submit a pull request to ETT's Dev branch, and it will go into code review, then be accepted and merged into the main repository! For additional resource on this process, check out GitHub's notes [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects), or this fun [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lGpZkjnkt4) (for those who are visual learners, although I don't have any free stickers).

The main steps (summarized):
1. [Fork the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)
2. [Clone the repository to your local machine](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#cloning-your-forked-repository) (If you want an easy dev environment that is more optimal, check out [this]() wiki article!)
3. Make a new branch off of Dev, describing any changes you intend to make.
4. Be sure to keep your branch up-to-date with current developments, by syncing changes when behind!
5. Commit your changes to your forked repository.
6. Once all changes are made, open a pull request to merge your work with the Dev branch of the main repository. Make sure you write a descriptive list of changes!

Please ensure that you as well do the following:

1. Your code should follow the existing style of the project to keep it readable for everyone (PowerShell is organized chaos, but we love it that way ðŸ¥²).
2. Make sure you have tested your changes thoroughly (Testing 1,2,3... is this thing on? ðŸ˜Ž)
3. Document new code based on how documentation is currently handled (comments and wiki FTW! ðŸ““).

## Code Review

If you contribute to the development branch, and open a pull request, a code review is called for. As is laid out in the [GitHub Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow#create-a-pull-request), other contributors and myself will review the change, provide feedback if necessary, and revisions as needed. Once this is set, we're on the road to a merge! NOTE: Due to the nonstandard method for this repository, there are currently no automated checks set at present.

## Wrapup

With all that set, it is important to remember that the project is voluntary, and we're all here to do a bit of good. Please be patient and respectful towards maintainers and other contributors. Else, safe and happy scripting!

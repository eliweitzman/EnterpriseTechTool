# How to Contribute to Eli's Enterprise Tech Toolkit!

First off, thank you so much for your interest in my app!

## Ideas

If you have an idea or feature request, but not the technical knowledge to back it fully, no fret! Just create an [issue](https://github.com/eliweitzman/EnterpriseTechTool/issues/new/choose) using the appropriate templace, and put in as many details as possible, and we'll try to get to it as quickly as possible!

## Contributing to Development

For ETT, there will be two main development branches. The main branch, which is updated at release, and the dev branch, which is where all changes will occur. If you want to make a change, the process is quite simple! Just create a personal fork of the repository, keep it up-to-date with the main repository, and make any modifications in the fork on the Dev branch. When it comes time for you to want to add it to the general codebase, submit a pull request to ETT's Dev branch, and it will go into code review, then be accepted and merged into the main repository! For additional resource on this process, check out GitHub's notes [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects).

## Code Review

If you contribute to the development branch, and open a pull request, a code review is called for. As is laid out in the [GitHub Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow#create-a-pull-request), other contributors and myself will review the change, provide feedback if necessary, and revisions as needed. Once this is set, we're on the road to a merge! NOTE: Due to the nonstandard method for this repository, there are currently no automated checks set at present.

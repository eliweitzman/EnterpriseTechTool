# How to Contribute to Eli's Enterprise Tech Toolkit!

First off, thank you so much for your interest in my app!

In terms of contributing, I'd like to keep the flow simple.

- Function requests or bugs can be filed in the issues section if requested.
- Additional code contribution can be handled with PRs on the active development branch.

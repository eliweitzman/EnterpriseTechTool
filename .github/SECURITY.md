# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Due to the nature of the application being effectively just a PowerShell script, releases are only supported in active development. Should a security issue arise on your current version, patches only roll on newer updates, and there is no backwards support cycle currently in place. 

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0     | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you encounter a security concern of extreme range, please get in touch with myself directly. Depending on the security issue however, this could be due to a vulnerability in PowerShell, or Windows as a whole. Else, if it's a low-priority security concern, you can create an issue with the "Security-Issue" tag and it can be added to active development roadmap if accepted. 

Because there isn't a set development routine in place yet, nor full-time development determined, security concerns will be evaluated and addressed whenever a development cycle is started.

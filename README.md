# Enterprise Tech Tool

Welcoem to Eli's Enterprise Tech Tool (ETT, for short lol). In this project, I hope to combine a bunch of useful sysadmin/helpdesk solutions that could be potentially helpful in general field work. Most of these projects are made from ideas I've had while at work, but hopefully some new functions come about soon!

## Recommended Experience before deployment

While it's optional, and I try to add as much context and instructions to the project as possible to run without experience, it would be good to have some experience in the following tools:

- PowerShell
- Active Directory

## General Disclaimer
I'm currently a college student, and this project was a small timefiller. I might not be able to add new features or maintain this too much in the future. Also, occasionally, you may find GenZ language used. But not too much ðŸ˜Ž
